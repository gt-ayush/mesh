# Mesh Network Demo — Overview

This project is a local offline communication system designed for hackathons and disaster scenarios.

## What It Does

- Allows 2–4 laptops or phones to chat without internet
- Works on local Wi-Fi or LAN
- Uses basic mesh-style flooding to share messages
- Includes simple XOR encryption for privacy

## Why It Matters

During disasters or internet shutdowns:
- WhatsApp/Telegram stop working
- People cannot contact teammates or family
- Mesh networks allow communication using nearby devices only

This demo proves a **minimal offline messaging system** using Python + Django.
